## Intro and Hook

- Nakuru is poised for an EV revolution, but here's the harsh truth:
- An estimated 75% of potential EV owners in the region are holding back due to a lack of reliable charging infrstructure.
- This hesitation could cost Nakuru's economic development and green job creation. 
- We're uncovering the hidden challenges and groundbreaking solutions that can turn this tide, and fast.

2-Minute Story Script (With Natural B-Roll Pauses)

“I’m standing at Shabaab Roundabout, one of the busiest transport points in the area.
[B-roll: wide shot of the roundabout, traffic, riders passing]

Just behind me is an ARC electric motorbike charging station.

This station supports ARC’s electric motorbikes, designed specifically for daily boda boda operations.

At first glance, the bikes look familiar—but the difference is how they’re powered.
No fuel, no exhaust fumes, and very little noise.

When a rider purchases an ARC electric motorbike, they’re set up with a digital wallet on the ARC app.
This wallet gives access to charging services across ARC stations.

At the charging station, a rider can scan a QR code or tap an NFC card to unlock a vacant charging port.

The system clearly shows available charging ports and the charge level of each battery, making the process simple and fast.

The ARC app also displays battery health, helping riders know when a battery needs attention or replacement.

For riders, this means lower running costs, less downtime, and predictable energy use.
[B-roll: rider riding off, interacting with passengers]

For the city, it means cleaner air and quieter streets.
[B-roll: city ambience, pedestrians, less noise]

ARC’s model shows how electric mobility can work in real, everyday conditions—right here at Shabaab Roundabout—supporting livelihoods while building a more sustainable future for urban transport.
